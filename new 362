1) There would be option to add comment
2) First User should login for add a comment otherwise will show warning for login
3) If login we should have email ID in state
4) Once comment added and click on Post then will send to backend via API
5) Will send email and comment text and post ID where commented

6) Comment box should open as a popup or lighbox


----
1) Receive postid, comment text, email ID
2) 


{
id:1
commentCount : 46
commentInfo: {
	emailid:"Text",
	likesCount:2,
	likesInfo:[emails]
}
}

-----
Cookies

We will set cookies with email IDs

1) wheneve first login with Google on successfully login, we will save email ID in cookies with 2hrs expiry.

2) so whenever first page load, we will check if any email ID is persist in cookies or not?
If yes, then we will pick that email ID and will send request to server and will get back data.
